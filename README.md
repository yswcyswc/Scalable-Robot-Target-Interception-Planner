# Scalable-Robot-Target-Interception-Planner
Time-aware interception planner for a robot navigating a weighted 2D grid with obstacles. The planner searches over future target positions to find the minimum-cost feasible interception, explicitly modeling waiting cost. Includes bounded search, plan caching across timesteps, and fallback strategies when interception is infeasible.
